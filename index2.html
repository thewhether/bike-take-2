                  <h3>Cyclists commute</h3>
                  <p>For many people a bicycle can be their primary means of transportation or a source of income. The League of American Bicyclists estimates that more than 1.2% of Houston's population uses a bicycle to commute or work. As Houston sees more and more transplants from more bike commuter-friendly cities, this percentage rises. A common misconception of commuter cyclists is that they are concentrated in the urban center, however, with Houston's highest population residing outside of Loop 610, we see more and more vulnerable road users active on two wheels in the outer rings of the geographic center.</p>

                  <h3>Cyclists are dying</h3>
                  <p>Due to a largely outdated plan for Cycling in the City of Houston, and only a relatively recently implentable initative toward "Complete Streets", Houston has been grossly negligent in tracking toward infrastructure updates that support a healthy bicycling environment. A history of car dependency supported by white flight, sprawling land availability and neutral attitude toward new urbanism has kept Houston firmly rooted in car-centricity that has left its inner city roadways poor channels for automobiles, and far worse for other more vulnerable road users.</p>

                  <h3>Driver's Ed.</h3>
                  <p>The League of American Bicylists recently designated Houston as a Bronze Level city, indicating that 1-in-10 cyclists is expected to experience an injurious crash during his or her lifetime. The Bronze is the lowest possible designation. As road usage by pedestrians and cyclists increases, so must awareness by both motored and non-motored road users. While ordinances like the Safe Passage ordinance and bicycle master plan are important symbols of support by Houston lawmakers, funding for driver education and cyclist education is imperative for helping to reduce crash rates and thereby fatalities. Injury and death occur when there is a lack of understanding, clarity or observation related to the expected action that any road party may take. Education and adherence to the basic understandings between all road users helps reduce the likelihood of a collision.</p>

                  <h3>Off-roading</h3>
                  <p>While Houston has not done a great deal to improve road conditions for cycling, the current administrators has worked well with the private sector to improve pathways, greenways, parks and Houston's robust wetlands. While this is does not address issues related to motorist/cyclists injuries or cohabitation, it can provide road alternatives for recreational cyclists and in some cases aide cycling commuters.</p>

                  <h3>Sharing is caring. Sorta.</h3>
                  <p>In 2012, Houston's newly founded Office of Sustainability was very active to make its presence known through some very public initatives. One of these was the introduction of a privately run Bike Share program known as Houston B-Cycle. B-Cycle is also in place in other Texas cities such as Austin and San Antonio. The program has largely been a success as measured by ridership, but has received significant criticism for not offering safeguards such as helmets and other educational opportunities to riders. Additionally, the City of Houston, admittedly launched the program in the absence of a significant understanding of how the linking inner city roadways would accomodate very novice, often unprotected and vulnerable cyclists taking advantage of the free service. The service has reported only 40 injuries and no deaths on any of its cycles nationwide, perhaps supporting safety arguments that defensive riders are safer than protected ones.</p>

                  <h3>Safe Passage?</h3>
                  <p>Though frequently lauded as a solution toward car/bike fatalities rates, the safe passage law and associated sting operations are criticized for not addressing the issue of driver awareness and better protected road rights for vulnerable road users. Safe passage laws require non-commercial vehicles to maintain a distance of at least 3' between them and a cyclist, while commercial vehicle drivers must keep more than 6' of space between them and cyclists. Critics point out that, though, widely unenforceable, this ordinance is supportive of improving road safety </p>
